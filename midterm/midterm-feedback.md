# Midterm Feedback

## Overall Score: 
49 / 50

You did a great job!  Nice work.


## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great.  One question will be: how do you determine if you should use PaO2 or A-a Gradient?

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - These all look great in general.  I like the generiic "range score" function.

Your FiO2 section used the FiO2 ranges niicely, but then had to hardcode getting either the 'Pa02' or 'A-a gradient' value sets.  If you had restructured your JSON slightly, then this wouldn't have needed to have that informaiton either.  (-1)


## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - All is correct.  YOU DID IT!! GREAT JOB!!!
Nice work.
